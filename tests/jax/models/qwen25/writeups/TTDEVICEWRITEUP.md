# Implementation of Qwen2.5-7B Model Using JAX on Tenstorrent

## Overview

The goal is to implement the Qwen2.5-7B model using JAX, leveraging Tenstorrent's capabilities for tensor parallelism. This involves sharding the model across virtual JAX devices and distributing it across Tenstorrent cores. The implementation will follow the guidelines outlined in the bounty description and utilize relevant documentation from Tenstorrent.

## Key Documentation References

1. **Tensor Sharding Documentation**:
   - **Link**: [Tensor Sharding](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/ttnn/latest/ttnn/tensor.html)
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Sharding refers to splitting a tensor across a distributed memory space, specifically L1 sharding across different cores.
     - Sharded tensors are represented in two dimensions, compressing higher rank tensors into two dimensions.
     - Important attributes include:
       - **Core Grid**: Represents the cores that will have a shard of a tensor.
       - **Shard Shape**: The shape of a single shard on each core.
       - **Sharding Strategy**: How the tensor will be split (height, width, or block sharding).
       - **Shard Orientation**: The order of the cores in the shard grid (row-major or column-major).

2. **Device Configuration Documentation**:
   - **Link**: [Device Configuration](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-mlir/specs/device.html)
   - **Key Concepts**:
     - Defines how to set up the device configuration to map logical devices to physical cores.
     - Provides examples of device attributes, including worker grids and mesh shapes.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Simulate Multiple JAX Devices

To simulate multiple JAX devices, set the `XLA_FLAGS` environment variable. This allows JAX to recognize multiple virtual devices.

```python
import os
os.environ["XLA_FLAGS"] = '--xla_force_host_platform_device_count=8'  # Simulate 8 devices
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
```

### 2. Define the Model

Create the Qwen2.5-7B model using Flax. The model should be designed to support tensor parallelism.

```python
from flax import linen as nn

class QwenModel(nn.Module):
    def setup(self):
        self.dense1 = nn.Dense(features=128)
        self.dense2 = nn.Dense(features=64)

    def __call__(self, x):
        x = self.dense1(x)
        x = nn.relu(x)
        x = self.dense2(x)
        return x
```

### 3. Create Input Data

Prepare the input data that will be sharded across the virtual devices.

```python
# Create a dummy input tensor
x = jnp.ones((8, 64, 64))  # 8 batches, 64x64 matrices
```

### 4. Shard the Input Tensor

Use JAX's sharding capabilities to distribute the input tensor across the virtual devices.

```python
from jax.sharding import PositionalSharding

# Shard the tensor across the virtual devices
sharding = PositionalSharding(jax.devices()[:8])  # Assuming 8 virtual devices
sharded_x = jax.device_put(x, sharding.reshape(1, 8))  # Reshape for sharding
```

### 5. Define Device Configuration for Tenstorrent

Set up the device configuration to map your logical devices to physical Tenstorrent cores.

```mlir
#tt.device<
  workerGrid = #tt.grid<8x8, (d0, d1) -> (0, d0, d1)>,  // Define the worker grid
  meshShape = 1,  // Mesh shape for a single chip
  chipIds = [0]   // Chip ID
>
```

### 6. Use pmap for Parallel Execution

Utilize JAX's `pmap` function to run the model in parallel across the virtual devices.

```python
# Initialize the model
model = QwenModel()

# Use pmap to distribute the computation across the virtual devices
@jax.pmap
def parallel_forward(x):
    return model(x)

# Run the model with sharded input
result = parallel_forward(sharded_x)
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps and utilizing the provided code snippets, you can effectively implement the Qwen2.5-7B model with JAX on Tenstorrent hardware. This implementation leverages the concepts of tensor sharding and device configuration as outlined in the Tenstorrent documentation.
